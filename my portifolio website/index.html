          Wellcome to my first practice on web development, an introduction to the front page of my website.
          This is a website  built to test my self on my journey to becoming a professional web developer.
          It has always be my dream to build webpages or sites that make our daily life activites faster and easier.
         The world already have powerful websites and softwares that makes life comfortable but there many other aspect of life that technology has not 
         checked.
         As a young and industerious guy, it is my ambition to contribute to solving the problems <span>mother earth  is facing.</span>
         so this website is an initial stage to start the <strong>dream</strong>

                I have many dreams, I know anyone out there do but mine is explained with little uniqueness.
                As an African, and a  Ghanaian prescily, I look at our continent and sometimes feel bad. Africa has less technological advancement,
                it has limited personnel that are into technology. Africa have numerous educational institutes that preaches about technnology but 
                it seems the enthusiasm of the youth to involve in technology is very awkward.
                Therefore this initiation is also a step to equipt the youth to know the very importances of being into technology and make use of it.

 <img class="smiley-1" src="images/speaking-head_1f5e3-fe0f.png"> When speaking of the topic of who a person
 is and their past, a massive part of this 
includes their educational background. 
 Isn’t this what forms people, their education? 
 Of course, this doesn’t always have to refer to 
their organized education.  Everything that a person
 learns is something that educates them; these words
 being synonymous.  Even something like first learning
 to tie your shoes is a part of your education.
  Which method works better for you: loop,
 swoop, and pull, or bunny ears?  I of course,
 like any other well educated person, use loop, 
swoop, and pull; it’s just the best way, 
no bias has ever developed there.

        Starting in Holiness preparatory school, 
  which had a lot of interactive learning,
   I began my first venture into organized education.
    This was a very warm environment, same as in my home,
   where caring and working with others was very important.
   I made a lot of friends in this school that I actually stayed with through all of high school. 
  When this short stint was finished.

        I graduated onto  <em class="em-item">Osei Kyeretwie Senior  High School</em> ,
        located at Old TAFO, of the Akyim Tafo Municipality,
        where I first learned that kissing a girl on the hand in kindergarten at story time wasn’t a good idea.
        In the Osei Kyeretwie Senior  High School system, ones learns a lot about the natural world around them.
        As a science student, biology helped with the learning of nature, i did some pyhsics,chemistry and mathematics. 
         like no other place on earth, the school  helped me grew academically.  This school was where I had a  teacher
          who had actually been in the person of Mr. Aduhene, whom everyone had a crush on.
        I learnt music as well which I loved every minute of, as it would become a large part of me.
         As any other high school, this was where I learned my basic stuff of course: typing,
         addition, speling, and even crazy things
